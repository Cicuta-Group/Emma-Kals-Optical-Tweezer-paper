# Emma-Kals-Optical-Tweezer-paper

This repository contains the tabulated data and analysis code used for the paper by Emma Kals et al. Optical tweezers reveal that PfEBA and PfRH ligands, not PfMSP1, play a central role in Plasmodium-falciparum merozoite-erythrocyte attachment. The files are organized into folders, according to the assay they correspond to. 

- `growth_assay` contains the data and analysis code for the growth assay.
- `growth_assay_GIA` contains the data and analysis code for the growth inhibition assay.
- `qPCR` contains the data and analysis code for the qPCR assay.
- `tweezer` contains the data and analysis code for the optical tweezer assay.
